# russell-champlain-bookmarks-app

Unfortunately was not able to complete functionality of the app.

So far I was able to add a bookmark but unable to further edit, delete, or visit the link.

was able to get the expand but wasn't able to close it and it hides the other bookmarks when expanded.

Need some guidance on where I'm going wrong.

Here is the live link.
